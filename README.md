# energy-datasets
The repository contains a collection of energy datasets. The license for individual datasets are referred in the source links. Primarily, the datasets are collected from the repository of [DUKE ENERGY INITIATIVE](https://energy.duke.edu/research/energy-data/resources). Furthermore the following sources are used to accumulate the energy datasets.

* [Mendeley](https://data.mendeley.com/)
* World Bank
* 

The goal of the project is to create an open source ground for domain integrated data science learning and application in the energy industry.
